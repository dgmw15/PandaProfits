# AI Code Editor Instructions

This file contains instructions and guidelines for AI-assisted development in the PandaProfits project.

## Project Overview
PandaProfits is a web application with three main components:

1. **Data Pipeline** (`data-pipeline/`): Handles data ingestion from web scraping and PDF processing
2. **Frontend** (`frontend/`): User interface for the web application
3. **Backend** (`backend/`): Server-side logic and API for the web application

## Development Guidelines

### General Principles
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between the three main components
- Follow consistent coding standards across all modules
- Document all major functions and API endpoints

### Data Pipeline
- Process scraped data efficiently
- Implement robust error handling for external data sources
- Ensure data validation before storage

### Frontend
- Create responsive and intuitive user interfaces
- Optimize for performance and accessibility
- Follow modern web development best practices

### Backend
- Design RESTful APIs where appropriate
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Ensure secure data handling

## Notes
Update this file as the project evolves with specific conventions, patterns, and requirements.
